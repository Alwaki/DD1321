# Course: DD1321 2019
# Student: Alexander Wall√©n Kiessling
# Project: Lab A
# Date: 1 July 2020
# Description: A program which defines a greedy best first algorothm, and uses it
# to find the best route between cities on an imported map file. Reworked version.
# Includes a debugging setting for further information.

# SETUP
# ---------------------

# Import packages
from Alexander import *
from classes import *

# Create instances
c = MapEdges()

# Set debugging mode on or off, which releases prints regarding status of algorithm
Debugging = False

# Testing prints
